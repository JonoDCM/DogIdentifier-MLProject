# ML Dog Identifier Project

## Overview
This repository contains the full Machine Learning Dog Identifier project, including the research paper, notebook, and implementation script.  
The project explores convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automated dog breed identification, combining methodology, experimentation, and results in one place.

## View the Notebook
You can **view** the notebook directly on GitHub (no execution or editing):
[ML_Dog_Identifier.ipynb](ML_Dog_Identifier.ipynb)

> Note: This notebook is provided for reference and visualization only.  
> Code execution and edits are disabled to preserve the original state.


## Research Paper
The complete written report, including methodology, evaluation, and results, is available here:  
[DogIdentifier-MLProject.pdf](DogIdentifier-MLProject.pdf)


## Script
